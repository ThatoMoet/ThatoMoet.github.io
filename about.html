    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <h3>An aspiring fullstack developer</h3>>
    <p>
        I am a second-year software developer student at WeThinkCode_. I was always interested in how new
        technologies can integrate with everyday life. My journey started in high school where I did
        Information Technology as a subject. I learned Delphi, a programming language that was used
        to introduce us to the fundamentals of coding such as variables, functions and conditional
        statements. This intrigued me but due to circumstances I was unable to pursue it in tertiary
        level.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing my Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations and Media Studies,
        I saw the opportunity to invest in my interests in providing solutions for the everyday life using software.
        Since being a student at WethinkCode_, I have encountered programming that emphasises on TDD approach,
        the importance of agile methodology when planning and developing software product. I have worked on a
        brownfield project that focuses on code refactoring as well as server-side and client-side communication.
